# PonyPixel for Derpy
Derpy bot

## How to run
* Install Python 3. Python 2 will NOT WORK. It **MUST** be Python 3.
* Download as a zip from the green `Code` button, and extract contents.
* Navigate to the downloaded file using `cd PonyPixel`
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to download requirements
* Run `pip install websocket-client` or `pip3 install websocket-client` cos that one module just hates me apparently
* Run `python -m venv env` or `python3 -m venv env`
* If you're on Linux run `env/bin/activate`, if you're on Windows run `env/Scripts/activate.bat` or `env/Scripts/activate.ps1` (do this every new terminal/command prompt you open to run bots)
* Run `python bot.py <username> <password>` or `python3 bot.py <username> <password>` and sit back.
